Existing motion datasets predominantly contain body-only poses, lacking facial expressions, hand gestures, and fine-grained pose descriptions. Moreover, they are primarily collected from limited laboratory scenes with textual descriptions manually labeled, which greatly limits their scalability. To overcome these limitations, we develop a whole-body motion and text annotation pipeline, which can automatically annotate motion from either single- or multi-view videos and provide comprehensive semantic labels for each video and fine-grained whole-body pose descriptions for each frame. This pipeline is of high precision, cost-effective, and scalable for further research. Based on it, we construct Motion-X, which comprises 15.6M precise 3D whole-body pose annotations (i.e., SMPL-X) covering 81.1K motion sequences from massive scenes. Besides, Motion-X provides 15.6M frame-level whole-body pose descriptions and 81.1K sequence-level semantic labels. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the annotation pipeline and the significant benefit of Motion-X in enhancing expressive, diverse, and natural motion generation, as well as 3D whole-body human mesh recovery.\\n\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nHuman motion generation aims to automatically synthesize natural human movements. It has wide applications in robotics, animation, games, and generative creation. Given a text description or audio command, motion generation can be controllable to obtain the desired human motion sequence. Text-conditioned motion generation has garnered increasing attention in recent years since it behaves in a more natural interactive way [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\\n\\nAlthough existing text-motion datasets [4, 11, 6, 8] have greatly facilitated the development of motion generation [2, 12, 13, 14, 9], their scale, diversity, and expressive capability remain unsatisfactory. Imagine generating \\\"a man is playing the piano happily,\\\" as depicted in Fig. 1(a), the motion from existing dataset [4] only includes the body movements, without finger movements or facial expressions. The missing hand gestures and facial expressions severely hinder the high level of expressiveness and realism of the motion. Additionally, certain specialized motions, such as high-level skiing, aerial work, and riding are challenging to be captured in indoor scenes. To sum up, existing datasets suffer from four main limitations: 1) body-only motions without facial expressions and hand poses; 2) insufficient diversity and quantity, only covering indoor scenes; 3) lacking diverse and long-term motion sequences; and 4) manual text labels that are unscalable, unprofessional and labor-intensive. These limitations hinder existing generation methods to synthesize expressive whole-body motion with diverse action types. Therefore, how to collect large-scale whole-body motion and text annotations from multi-scenarios are critical in addressing the data scarcity issue.\\n\\n\u2217Equal Contribution, \u2021Work done during an internship at IDEA\\n\u2020 Corresponding author\"}"}

We highlight the comparisons of facial expressions and hand gestures.\\n\\nCompared to indoor marker-based mocap systems, markerless vision-based motion capture methods [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20] become promising to capture large-scale motions from massive videos. Meanwhile, human motion can be regarded as a sequence of kinematic structures, which can be automatically translated into pose scripts using rule-based techniques [3]. More importantly, although markerless capture (e.g., pseudo labels) is not as precise as marker-based methods, collecting massive and informative motions, especially local motions, could still be beneficial [21, 15, 22, 23, 24]. Besides, text-driven motion generation task requires semantically corresponding motion labels instead of vertex-corresponding mesh labels, and thus have a higher tolerance of motion capture error. Bearing these considerations in mind, we design a scalable and systematic pipeline for motion and text annotation in both multi-view and single-view videos. Firstly, we gather and filter massive video recordings from a variety of scenes with challenging, high-quality, multi-style motions and sequence-level semantic labels. Subsequently, we estimate and optimize the parameters of the SMPL-X model [25] for the whole-body motion annotation. Due to the depth ambiguity and various challenges in different scenes, existing monocular estimation models typically fail to yield satisfactory results. To address this issue, we systematically design a high-performance framework incorporating several innovative techniques, including a hierarchical approach for whole-body keypoint estimation, a score-guided adaptive temporal smoothing and optimization scheme, and a learning-based 3D human model fitting process. By integrating these techniques, we can accurately and efficiently capture the ultimate 3D motions. Finally, we design an automatic algorithm to caption frame-level descriptions of whole-body poses. We obtain the body and hand scripts by calculating spatial relations among body parts and hand fingers based on the SMPL-X parameters and extract the facial expressions with an emotion classifier. We then aggregate the low-level pose information and translate it into textual pose descriptions.\\n\\nBased on the pipeline, we collect a large-scale whole-body expressive motion dataset named Motion-X, which includes 15.6M frames and 81.1K sequences with precise 3D whole-body motion annotations, pose descriptions, and semantic labels. To compile this dataset, we collect massive videos from the Internet, with a particular focus on game and animation motions, professional performance, and diverse outdoor actions. Additionally, we incorporated data from eight existing action datasets [26, 27, 28, 11, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Using Motion-X, we build a benchmark for evaluating several state-of-the-art (SOTA) motion generation methods. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of Motion-X for diverse, expressive, and realistic motion generation (shown in Fig. 1 (b)). Furthermore, we validate the versatility and quality of Motion-X on the whole-body mesh recovery task.\\n\\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\\n\\n\u2022 We propose a large-scale expressive motion dataset with precise 3D whole-body motions and corresponding sequence-level and frame-level text descriptions.\\n\u2022 We elaborately design a automatic motion and text annotation pipeline, enabling efficient capture of high-quality human text-motion data at scale.\\n\u2022 Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the motion annotation pipeline and the benefits of Motion-X in 3D whole-body motion generation and mesh recovery tasks.\\n\\n2 Preliminary and Related Work\\n\\nIn this section, we focus on introducing existing datasets for human motion generation.

The first column shows the name and public year of datasets. Motion-X provides both indoor and outdoor whole-body motion and text annotations. Benchmarks annotated with sequential human motion and text are mainly collected for three tasks: action recognition [33, 27, 34, 28, 35, 36], human object interaction [37, 38, 39, 29, 32, 40], and motion generation [4, 41, 11, 6, 8, 24]. Specifically, KIT Motion-Language Dataset [6] is the first public dataset with human motion and language descriptions, enabling multi-modality motion generation [1, 5]. Although several indoor human motion capture (mocap) datasets have been developed [42, 43, 44, 45], they are scattered. AMASS [11] is noteworthy as it collects and unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets to build a large-scale motion dataset through a common framework and parameterization via SMPL [46]. This great milestone benefits motion modeling and its downstream tasks. Additionally, BABEL [8] and HumanML3D [4] contribute to the language labels through crowdsourced data collection. BABEL proposes either sequence labels or sub-sequence labels for a sequential motion, while HumanML3D collects three text descriptions for each motion clip from different workers. Thanks to these text-motion datasets, various motion generation methods have rapidly developed and shown advantages in diverse, realistic, and fine-grained motion generation [2, 14, 47, 48, 9, 10].\\n\\nHowever, existing text-motion datasets have several limitations, including the absence of facial expressions and hand gestures, insufficient data quantity, limited diversity of motions and scenes, coarse-grained and ambiguous descriptions, and the lack of long sequence motions. To bridge these gaps, we develop a large-scale whole-body expressive motion dataset with comprehensive sequence- and frame-level text labels. We aim to address these limitations and open up new possibilities for future research. We provide quantitative comparisons of Motion-X and existing datasets in Tab. 1.\\n\\n3 Motion-X Dataset\\n3.1 Overview\\nAs shown in Tab. 2, we collect Motion-X from eight datasets and online videos and provide the following motion and text annotations: 15.6M 3D whole-body SMPL-X annotation, 81.1K sequence-level semantic descriptions (e.g., walking with waving hand and laughing), and frame-level whole-body pose descriptions. Notably, original sub-datasets lack either whole-body motion or text labels and we unify them with our annotation pipeline. All annotations are manually checked to guarantee quality. In Fig. 2, we show the averaged temporal standard deviation of body, hand, and face keypoints of each sub-dataset, highlighting the diversity of hand movements and facial expressions, which fills in the gaps of previous body-only motion data.\\n\\nData\\n| Clip | Frame | GT Motion | P-GT Motion | Text |\\n|------|-------|-----------|-------------|------|\\n| AMASS [4] | 26.3K | 5.4M | B, H | F |\\n| SHAA500 [27] | 5.2K | 0.3M | B, H, F |\\n| SAIST [30] | 1.4K | 0.3M | B, H, F |\\n| SHuMMan [26] | 0.7K | 0.1M | - |\\n| BAUM [31] | 1.4K | 0.2M | F |\\n| SIDEA400* | 12.5K | 2.6M | B, H, F |\\n| Online Videos* | 32.5K | 6.0M | B, H, F |\\n| Motion-X | 81.1K | 15.6M | B, H | B, H, F |\\n\\nTable 2: Statistics of sub-datasets.

For these datasets, steps 1 and 2 are skipped. Notably, only EgoBody and GRAB datasets provide SMPL-X labels with body and hand pose, thus we annotate the SMPL-X label for the other motions. For AMASS, which contains the body and roughly static hand motions, we skip step 4 and fill in the facial expression with a data augmentation mechanism. The facial expressions are collected from a facial datasets BAUM via a face capture and animation model EMOCA. To enrich the expressive whole-body motions, we record an dataset IDEA400, which provides 13K motion sequences covering 400 diverse actions. Details about the processing of each sub-dataset and IDEA400 are available in the appendix.\\n\\nTo improve the appearance and motion diversity, we collect 32.5K monocular videos from online sources, covering various real-life scenes as depicted in Fig. 4. Since human motions and actions are context-dependent and vary with the scenario, we design action categories as motion prompts based on the scenario and function of the action via LLM. To ensure comprehensive coverage of human actions, our dataset includes both general and domain-specific scenes. The general scenes encompass daily actions (e.g., brushing hair, wearing glasses, and applying creams), sports activities (e.g., high knee, kick legs, push-ups), various musical instrument playing, and outdoor scenes (e.g., BMX riding, CPR, building snowman). The inclusion of general scenes helps bridge the gap between existing data and real-life scenarios. In addition, we incorporate domain-specific scenes that require high professional skills, such as dance, Kung Fu, Tai Chi, performing arts, Olympic events, entertainment.\"}"}

Although recent approaches have utilized separate networks to decode features of different body parts [51, 52], they often struggle with hand-missing detection and are prone to errors due to occlusion or interaction. To overcome these limitations, we customize a novel hierarchical keypoint annotation method, depicted in the blue box of Fig. 5. We train a ViT-WholeBody based on a ViT-based model [18] on the COCO-Wholebody dataset [51] to estimate initial whole-body keypoints $K_{2D} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{133 \\\\times 2}$ with confidence scores. Leveraging the ViT model's ability to model semantic relations between full-body parts, we enhance hand and face detection robustness even under severe occlusion. Subsequently, we obtain the hand and face bounding boxes based on the keypoints, and refine the boxes using the BodyHands detector [53] through an IoU matching operation. Finally, we feed the cropped body, hand, and face regions into three separately pre-trained ViT networks to estimate body, hand and face keypoints, which are used to update $K_{2D}$.\\n\\nScore-guided Adaptive Smoothing.\\n\\nTo address the jitter resulting from per-frame pose estimation in challenging scenarios such as heavy occlusion, truncation, and motion blur, while preserving motion details, we introduce a novel score-guided adaptive smoothing technique into the traditional Savitzky-Golay filter [54]. The filter is applied to a sequence of 2D keypoints of a motion:\\n\\n$$\\\\bar{K}_{2D}^i = \\\\sum_{j=-w}^{w-c} w_j \\\\cdot K_{2D}^i + j,$$\\n\\nwhere $K_{2D}^i$ is the original keypoints of the $i$th frame, $\\\\bar{K}_{2D}^i$ is the smoothed keypoints, $w$ corresponds to half-width of filter window size, and $c_j$ are the filter coefficients. Different from existing smoothing methods with a fixed window size [55, 56, 54], we leverage the confidence scores of the keypoints to adaptively adjust the window size to balance between smoothness and motion details. Using a larger window size for keypoints with lower confidence scores can mitigate the impact of outliers.\\n\\n3D Keypoint Annotation.\\n\\nPrecise 3D keypoint can boost the estimation of SMPL-X. We utilize novel information from large-scale pre-trained models. Accordingly, for single-view videos, we adopt a pretrained model [57], which is trained on massive 3D datasets, to estimate precise 3D keypoints. For multi-view videos, we utilize bundle adjustment to calibrate and refine the camera parameters, and\"}"}

Due to the page limit, we leave more details about experimental setups and evaluation metrics in the appendix.\\n\\n**Benchmarking Motion-X.** We train and evaluate four diffusion-based motion generation methods, including MDM [14], MLD [2], MotionDiffuse [9] and T2M-GPT [48] on our dataset. Since previous datasets only have sequence-level motion descriptions, we keep similar settings for minimal model adaptation and take the semantic label as text input. The evaluation is conducted with 20 runs (except for Multimodality with 5 runs) under a 95% confidence interval. From Tab. 4, MotionDiffuse demonstrates a superior performance across most metrics. However, it scores the lowest in Multimodality, indicating that it generates less varied motion. Notably, T2M-GPT achieves comparable performance on our dataset while maintaining high diversity, indicating our large-scale dataset\u2019s promising prospects to enhance the GPT-based method\u2019s efficacy. MDM gets the highest Multimodality score with the lowest precision, indicating the generation of noisy and jittery motions. The highest Top-1 precision is 55.9%, showing the challenges of Motion-X. MLD adopts the latent space design, making it fast while maintaining competent results. Therefore, we use MLD to conduct the following experiments to compare Motion-X with the existing largest motion dataset HumanML3D and ablation studies.\\n\\n**Comparison with HumanML3D.** To validate the richness, expressiveness, and effectiveness of our dataset, we conduct a comparative analysis between Motion-X and HumanML3D, which is the largest existing dataset with text-motion labels. We replace the original vector-format poses of HumanML3D with the corresponding SMPL-X parameters from AMASS [11], and randomly extract facial expressions from BAUM [31] to fill in the face parameters. We train MLD separately on the training sets of Motion-X and HumanML3D, then evaluate both models on the two test sets. The results in Tab. 5 reveal some valuable insights. Firstly, Motion-X exhibits greater diversity (13.174) than HumanML3D (9.837), as evidenced by the real (GT) row. This indicates a wider range of motion types captured by Motion-X. Secondly, the model pretrained on Motion-X and then fine-tuned on HumanML3D subset performs well on...\"}"}

MPVPE (mm) is reported.\\n\\nThe HumanML3D test set, even better than the intra-data training. These superior performances stem from the fact that Motion-X encompasses diverse motion types from massive outdoor and indoor scenes. For a more intuitive comparison, we provide the visual results of the generated motion in Fig. 8, where we can clearly see that the model trained on Motion-X excels at synthesizing semantically corresponding motions given text inputs. These results prove the significant advantages of Motion-X in enhancing expressive, diverse, and natural motion generation.\\n\\nAblation study of text labels. In addition to sequence-level semantic labels, the text labels in Motion-X also include frame-level pose descriptions, which is an important characteristic of our dataset. To assess the effectiveness of pose description, we conducted an ablation study on the text labels. The baseline model solely utilizes the semantic label as the text input. Since there is no method to use these labels, we simply sample a single sentence from the pose descriptions randomly, concatenate it with the semantic label, and feed the combined input into the CLIP text encoder. Interestingly, from Tab. 6, adding additional face and body pose texts brings consistent improvements, and combining whole-body pose descriptions results in a noteworthy 38% reduction in FID. These results validate that the proposed whole-body pose description contributes to generating more accurate and realistic human motions. More effective methods to utilize these labels can be explored in the future.\\n\\n5.3 Impact on Whole-body Human Mesh Recovery\\n\\nAs discovered in this benchmark [21], the performance of mesh recovery methods can be significantly improved by utilizing high-quality pseudo-SMPL labels. Motion-X provides a large volume of RGB images and well-annotated SMPL-X labels. To verify its usefulness in the 3D whole-body mesh recovery task, we take Hand4Whole [17] as an example and evaluate MPVPE on the widely-used AGORA val [71] and EHF [25] datasets. For the baseline model, we train it on the commonly used COCO [51], Human3.6M [72], and MPII [73] datasets. We then train another model by incorporating an additional 10% of the single-view data sampled from Motion-X while keeping the other setting the same. As shown in Tab. 7, the model trained with Motion-X shows a significant decrease of 7.8% in MPVPE on EHF and AGORA compared to the baseline model. The gains come from the increase in diverse appearances and poses in Motion-X, indicating the effectiveness and accuracy of the motion annotations in Motion-X and its ability to benefit the 3D reconstruction task.\\n\\n6 Conclusion\\n\\nIn this paper, we present Motion-X, a comprehensive and large-scale 3D expressive whole-body human motion dataset. It addresses the limitations of existing mocap datasets, which primarily focus on indoor body-only motions with limited action types. The dataset consists of 144.2 hours of whole-body motions and corresponding text labels. To build the dataset, we develop a systematic annotation pipeline to annotate 81.1K 3D whole-body motions, sequence-level motion semantic labels, and 15.6M frame-level whole-body pose descriptions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the motion annotation pipeline and the significant benefit of Motion-X in enhancing expressive, diverse, and natural motion generation, as well as 3D whole-body human mesh recovery.\\n\\nLimitation and future work. There are two main limitations of our work. Firstly, the motion quality of our markless motion annotation pipeline is inevitably inferior to the multi-view marker-based motion capture system. Secondly, during our experiment, we found out that existing evaluation metrics are not always consistent with visual results. Thus, there is a need for further development of the motion generation models and evaluation metrics. As a large-scale dataset with multiple modalities, e.g., motion, text, video, and audio, Motion-X holds great potential for advancing downstream tasks, such as motion prior learning, understanding, and multi-modality pre-training. Besides, our large-scale dataset and scalable annotation pipeline open up possibilities for combining this task with a large language model (LLM) to achieve an exciting motion generation result in the future. With Motion-X, we hope to benefit and facilitate further research in relevant fields.\"}"}
