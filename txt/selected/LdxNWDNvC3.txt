Abstract
Data-driven generative models have emerged as promising approaches towards
achieving efficient mechanical inverse design. However, due to prohibitively high
cost in time and money, there is still lack of open-source and large-scale bench-
marks in this field. It is mainly the case for airfoil inverse design, which requires to
generate and edit diverse geometric-qualified and aerodynamic-qualified airfoils
following the multimodal instructions,i.e., dragging points and physical parameters.
This paper presents the open-source endeavors in airfoil inverse design, AFBench,
including a large-scale dataset with 200 thousand airfoils and high-quality aerody-
namic and geometric labels, two novel and practical airfoil inverse design tasks,i.e.,
conditional generation on multimodal physical parameters, controllable editing,
and comprehensive metrics to evaluate various existing airfoil inverse design meth-
ods. Our aim is to establish AFBench as an ecosystem for training and evaluating
airfoil inverse design methods, with a specific focus on data-driven controllable
inverse design models by multimodal instructions capable of bridging the gap
between ideas and execution, the academic research and industrial applications.
We have provided baseline models, comprehensive experimental observations,
and analysis to accelerate future research. Our baseline model is trained on an

1 Introduction
The airfoil inverse design problem serves as the center of the automatic airfoil design, which is to seek
design input variables, i.e., physical parameters, to optimize an underlying objective function, e.g.,
aerodynamics. Previous methods can be divided into two categories: optimization methods [1, 2, 3]
and data-driven methods [4, 5, 6, 7]. First, the optimization-based methods usually design an objective
function by constructing a mathematical model and leverage the typical optimization algorithms, e.g.,
genetic algorithms [8], adjoint optimization [9] and topology optimization [10], to find the optimal
input variables as the design parameters. Despite the success, these methods have limitations in
considerable time consumption and the diversity of the optimal design variables due to the constructed
physical model of airfoils. Second, the data-driven methods [11, 12, 13, 14] typically borrow ideas
from the advancements in conditional generative models in artificial intelligence. Popular generative
methods such as CGAN [ 15], CV AE [16], and Diffusion models [ 17, 18] have been explored,
demonstrating their effectiveness. However, current data-driven methods suffer from the following
three drawbacks. First, the existing datasets are relatively small-scale, e.g., the design geometry
dataset UIUC [19] contain only thousands of samples. Therefore, data-driven models trained on such
datasets have limited generalization capabilities and fail to generate diverse solutions that meet the
requirements. Second, the current datasets typically provide only a single condition, i.e.,aerodynamic
parameters, and thus cannot handle multi-condition design, i.e., controlling leading edge radius and
upper crest position as geometric parameters simultaneously, which are real industrial applications in
airfoil design. Third, current airfoil inverse design methods do not support progressive editing existing
designs according to manual and multimodal requirements, which limits their applications in the
industry. For example, one of our authors from Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute, who
has over 10 years experiences for airfoil design, claimed that each airfoils used in current commercial
airplanes underwent years of progressively refinements by hundreds of engineers.
To drive the development of generative models in the field of engineering design, we construct a
comprehensive airfoil benchmark,AFBench, that can be a cornerstone to cope with the aforementioned
challenges with the following merits:
(1) Tasks – Multi-Conditional Generation and Editing in Airfoil Inverse Design: Regarding
the aforementioned dataset, we tailor it to accommodate two new but more practical tasks in real
airfoil design: multi-conditional airfoil generation and multimodal airfoil editing. The task of
airfoil generation is not limited to the previous approach of generating airfoils based solely on given
aerodynamic labels such as Lift-to-drag ratio. Instead, it involves generating airfoils based on multiple
intricate geometric labels proposed by our authors who are experts in airfoil designs, which is more
challenge but practical than previous airfoil generation based on the single condition. We introduce
a newly developed airfoil editing task, which currently allows for the modification of both control
points and physical parameters of the airfoil. The editing of physical parameters is not present
in traditional airfoil editing software, and the movement of control points, compared to the spline
interpolation in traditional software, is enabled by AI models with a broader design space.
(2) Datasets - Large-scale Airfoil Datasets with High-quality and Comprehensive Geometric
and Aerodynamic Labels: Regarding the aforementioned airfoil inverse design tasks, the training
subset of the proposed AFBench consists of 200,000 well-designed both synthetic and manually-
designed airfoils with 11 geometric parameters and aerodynamic properties under 66 work conditions
(Mach number from 0.2 to 0.7, Lift coefficient from 0 to 2). To construct the AFBench, we propose
an automatic data engine that includes data synthesis, high-quality annotations and low-quality
filtering. Different from previous datasets, we (i) not only combine all airfoils in the existing
datasets such as such as UIUC [19] and NACA [20], but also include 2,150 new manually-designed
supercritical airfoils from Shanghai Aircraft Design and Research Institute that is highly insufficient
in existing datasets; (ii) further enlarge the dataset to 200,000 airfoils by effective data synthesis
with conventional physical models and unconditional generative models; (iii) annotate geometric and
aerodynamic labels by CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) simulation software.
(3) Open-source Codebase and Benchmarks – A Open-source Codebase of Data-driven Gen-
erative Models for Airfoil Inverse Design with State-of-the-art Methods and Comprehensive

Evaluation Metrics: Since there are still absent a comprehensive and clean codebase to compare
and analyze different airfoil inverse design methods, we release a comprehensive and publicly ac-
cessible codebase to facilitate future researches. This codebase includes multiple existing methods,
e.g., cV AE [21, 22, 23], cGAN [ 24, 25], and our newly proposed primary architectures for both
multi-conditional airfoil generation and controllable airfoil editing, PK-V AE, PK-V AE2, PK-GAN,
PKV AE-GAN, PK-DIFF, PK-DiT inspired by mainstream generative frameworks,i.e., V AE, GAN
and Diffusion models. To facilitate exploration and usage, we have also provided a user-friendly
demo that easily allows different airfoil inverse design methods for online generation and editing.
Furthermore, different from previous benchmarks that only evaluates the aerodynamic performance,
we also provide the interface to evaluate the geometric quality, the aerodynamic quality and the
diversity of the generated airfoils, which are also crucial for airfoil inverse design.
The main contributions of this work are summarized as follows:
• We propose the use of generative methods for two key tasks in airfoil design: multi-
conditional airfoil generation and airfoil editing. We also establish comprehensive evaluation
metrics including diversity, controllability, geometric quality and aerodynamic quality.
• We propose a large-scale and diverse airfoil dataset in Airfoil Generative Design. This
dataset includes 200 thoushands airfoil shapes, accompanied by detailed geometric and
aerodynamic annotation labels. The dataset can provide valuable resources for training and
evaluating generative models in airfoil inverse design.
• We construct and open-source a codebase that encompasses generative methods in airfoil
design, including foundational techniques such as cV AE, cGAN as well as advanced models
like PK-GAN,PK-V AE,PKV AE-GAN and PK-DiT. We provide a user-friendly demo that
allows for visualizing and experiencing airfoil design in real-time.
2 Related Work
Airfoil Inverse Design.The ultimate goal of airfoil inverse design is to use algorithms to automatically
find airfoils that meet the given requirements. Previous efforts [26, 27] have explored datasets for
investigating airfoil aerodynamic characteristics, but have largely relied on the UIUC and NACA
airfoil shapes, lacking the support to explore large-scale airfoil models. Our dataset, on the other
hand, boasts a more diverse collection of airfoils and rich annotations. Additionally, we have
proposed AFBench, which includes airfoil generation and airfoil editing. Airfoil generation is a
combination and complement to inverse design and parameterization, as it can generate airfoils that
satisfy geometric constraints based on PARSEC parameters. We also propose a new task, airfoil
editing, to allow designers to more easily find the optimal airfoil based on their experience.
Conditional Generative methods in Airfoil Design. There are some new attempts to leveraging
the advantages of both implicit representation and generative methods in airfoil design. Variation
Auto Encoder[28] trains a model to minimize reconstruction loss and latent loss, and it is usually
optimized considering the sum of these losses. [22] proposes two advanced CV AE for the inverse
airfoil design problems by combining (CV AE) and distributions.Generative adversarial network[29]
uses a generative neural network to generate a airfoil and uses a discriminative neural network to
justify the airfoil is real or fake. CGAN [15] improves the original GAN by inputting the conditions
to both the generator and discriminator. For instance, [ 30] generates shapes with low or high lift
coefficient. By inputing the aerodynamic characteristics such as lift-to-drag ratio (Cl/Cd) or shape
parameters, it is possible to guide the shape generation process toward particular airfoil. Diffusion
model [17] is the emerging generative models [14, 31, 13] in engineering design. However, there are
still few attempts in airfoil inverse design. We provide more detailed literature review in Appendix B.
3 Automatic Data Engine
Since diverse airfoil datasets are not easily accessible publicly, we develop a data engine to collect
200,000 diverse airfoils, dubbed AF-200K. Our proposed AF-200K dataset first includes airfoils
from two public datasets, such as UIUC and NACA, and then leverages our proposed data engine to
generate synthetic airfoils. The data engine has three stages: (1) synthetic airfoil generation stage; (2)
geometric and aerodynamic parameter annotation stage; (3) low-quality airfoil filtering stage. We
illustrate the data engine pipeline in Fig. 2 and visualize generated airfoils in Fig. 3.

3.1 Synthetic Airfoil Generation Stage
Based on airfoils in UIUC and newly collected airfoils that are manually designed by COMAC
(Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China), we synthesize airfoils by both physical models and
unconditional generative methods.
CST-assisted Generation. The CST-assisted Generation synthesizes the airfoils firstly by parameter-
izing physical models, i.e., CST model and then perturbing these parameters. Given one manually
designed airfoil f0, we parameterize the airfoil with the CST method [32] as p0 = (p1
0, p2
0, ..., pM
0 ),
where M is the number of physical parameters2. Afterwards, we perturb the parameters of the airfoils
with Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). Take generating N airfoils based on one manually-designed
airfoil for example. For every variable (p1
0, p2
0, ..., pM
0 )in our parameterized airfoil, we evenly divided
into N parts, and randomly sample a value in N parts, respectively for N generated airfoils. With
Latin hypercube sampling (LHS), the generated airfoils can be uniformly sampled from the parametric
space of CST for supercritical airfoils. The generated airfoils are illustrated in Fig. 3.
Unconditional Airfoil Generation Stage. While the airfoils generated by perturbing the parameters
of CST models significantly extend the training datasets, the design space is still limited to the
capability of CST models (Fig. 3). To further explore the more general design space, we propose two
unconditional generative-model-based methods, i.e., BézierGAN [33] and diffusion models [17], to
generate airfoils in the training set. Specifically, we train BézierGAN [33] and diffusion models [17]
using our selected airfoils from the UIUC dataset (referred to as UIUC-Picked). We generate 10,000
airfoils with BézierGAN and generate another 10,000 airfoils with the diffusion model. We will
detail the architecture of BézierGAN and diffusion model in the Appendix D.
2The exact formulation of CST models and fitting methods are detailed in the Appendix C.

3.2 Geometric and Aerodynamic Parameter Annotation Stage
Aerodynamic Annotation. We compute the angle of attack (AoA) and drag coefficient (CD) of each
airfoil under different working conditions. Specifically, we set the Reynolds number to 100,000 and
vary the Mach number from 0.2 to 0.7 (in increments of 0.1), and the lift coefficient (CL) from 0.0
to 2.0 (in increments of 0.2). The working conditions are denoted as wc = [Ma, CL], where Ma
is the Mach number and CL is the lift coefficient. For each working condition, we pass the airfoil
coordinates into XFoil [34] to calculate the corresponding aerodynamic labels, including the angle of
attack (AoA), drag coefficient (CD), and moment coefficient (CM).
Geometric Annotation. The Geometric label is primarily based on PARSEC physical parameters,
with Control keypoints as supplementary information. The PARSEC physical parameters (as shown
in Fig. 4) include the leading edge radius (Rle), upper crest position (Xup, Yup), upper crest curvature
(Zxxup), lower crest position (Xlo, Ylo), lower crest curvature (Zxxlo), trailing edge position (Yte),
trailing thickness (∆Yte), and two trailing edge angles (αte, βte).

Figure 4: PARSEC physical parameters
We utilize B-spline [ 35] interpolation to con-
vert the discrete points into a continuous repre-
sentation, and then calculate the first-order and
second-order derivatives, as well as the extrema.
For the Control Keypoints, we select a subset
of the airfoil surface points, approximately one-
twentieth of the original number of points. The
main purpose is to control the overall contour
of the airfoil, ensuring that it does not undergo
drastic changes.
3.3 Airfoil Filtering Stage
Given the airfoils generated with the parametric CST model and the generative model, we need to
filter out those with low aerodynamic performance to prevent the generative model from producing
low-quality airfoils. Specifically, we use a numerical solver based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-
Stokes (RANS) equations to calculate the physical parameters of flow fields. These parameters are
then used to assess the aerodynamic performance of the generated airfoils. We set 66 work conditions
(as detailed in Section 3.2), and if an airfoil fails to converge under all 66 conditions, we classify it as
a poor-quality airfoil and discard it.

4 AFBench: Dataset Presentation and Benchmarking Setup
4.1 Dataset Presentation
Based on the aforementioned automatic data engine, the AF-200K dataset includes a diverse collection
of about 200,000 airfoils, including UIUC, NACA, supercritical airfoils, and generated airfoils, as
shown in Fig. 5. From the UIUC dataset, we have carefully selected 1,433 airfoils with favorable
aerodynamic performance from more than 1,600 original raw data entries. For the NACA airfoils, we
referenced the AIRFRANS [27] design space, resulting in a total of 5,000 NACA 4-digit and 5,000
NACA 5-digit airfoils. The Supercritical Airfoil dataset was generated by perturbing and expanding
upon designs provided by COMAC engineers, using the CST method, yielding a total of 21,500
airfoils. To further augment the UIUC dataset, we generated 143,300 airfoils through CST-assisted
generation. Additionally, we employed generative modeling approaches to synthesize 10,000 airfoils
each using BézierGAN [33] and diffusion models [17]. All airfoil data are stored in the form of 2D
coordinates, with each airfoil represented by 257 points. In cases where the original data did not
have 257 points, we used B-spline interpolation to ensure a consistent representation. The AF-200K
dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets with a ratio of 8:1:1.
4.2 Airfoil Inverse Design Tasks
Controllable Airfoil Generation. The controllable airfoil task aims at generating airfoils, which
is described by 257 points, given the physical parameters and control keypoints. We expect the
generated airfoil should consist with the given physical parameters and control keypoints and also
with high diversity, good geometric quality and aerodynamic quality.
Editable Airfoil Generation. The editable airfoil generation task aims at editing a given airfoil
following the instruction. Specifically, the editable airfoil we can edit the airfoil using the physical
parameters and control keypoints, e.g., 2 times enlarging the leading edge, or dragging one of the
control point. We expect the airfoil after editting can be conformed to the instruction. We expect the
airfoil after editing should be consist with the given physical parameters or control keypoints and
also with high diversity, good geometric quality and aerodynamic quality.
4.3 Baseline Methods
As shown in Fig. 6, we train four generative models: V AE, GAN, V AE-GAN and Diffusion Models.
PK-V AE andPK-V AE2. Based on [ 36], we modify the plain V AE by incorporating parsec
parameters [37] and control keypoints as geometry constraints. PK-V AE2 is a composite of V AEs:
EK-V AE, PK-V AE and PK-V AE, which enable airfoil editing. Speicifically, EK-V AE achieves editing
by predicting physical parameters from control keypoints, while EP-V AE predicts control keypoints
6

from physical parameters. By training these components separately and then combining them with
PK-V AE for joint training, we can achieve efficient airfoil editing.
PK-GAN. Building upon the Bézier-GAN approach [33], we introduce a conditional formulation in
our model. We employ a technique similar to Adaptive Instance Normalization [38] to seamlessly
integrate the condition embedding at multiple scales within the Generator. Simultaneously, we adopt
a similarity-based approach to blend the condition information into the Discriminator.
PKV AE-GAN.Inspired by [39], we utilize a conditional Variational Autoencoder (cV AE) as the
generator, and train it with the discriminator conditioned on physical parameters and keypoints.
PK-Diffusion. For conditional diffusion models [18, 40], we designed two types based on Unet [41]
and Transformer [40] architectures. In the U-Net model (PK-DIFF), the encoder extracts features by
stacking multiple layers of convolutions, while the decoder reconstructs features by stacking multiple
layers of convolutions. The encoder outputs are concatenated with the corresponding scale inputs
of the decoder through skip connections. The time steps and conditions are mapped through MLP
layers and then integrated with the input features. In the DIT model (PK-DIT), we also integrate time
steps and conditions by employing MLP to map them before feature extraction. Feature extraction is
performed through four layers of DIT blocks.
4.4 Evaluation Metrics
The performance of the model depends on three factors: controllability, diversity of the gener-
ated/edited airfoils, and quality of the generated airfoils (including both geometric and aerodynamic
quality). We evaluate the performance using the following metrics:
• To measure the constraint of the conditions, we propose the label error:
σi = |ˆpi − pi|, i= 1, 2, ...,11 (1)
where σi is the label error for the i-th physical parameter, ˆpi is the i-th physical param-
eter calculated from the generated airfoil, pi is the i-th physical parameter of the given
condition. We denote {pi}11
i=1 as {Rle,Xup, Yup,Zxxup,Xlo,Ylo,Zxxlo,Yte,∆Yte,αte, βte},
respectively.
• To quantify the diversity of the generated airfoils, we propose the following formula:
D = 1
n
nX
i=1
log det(LSi ), (2)
where n is the number of sample times, and the set of generated airfoils is denoted as
F = (f1, f2, ..., fM ). The i-th subset of the data, Si, is a subset of F with a smaller size N
(where N < M). The matrix LSi is the similarity matrix, calculated based on the Euclidean
distances between the airfoils in the subset Si, as proposed in [42]. The det(LSi ) represents
the determinant of the similarity matrix LSi , and the log det(LSi ) is the natural logarithm
of the determinant, which is used to prevent numerical underflow.
• To measure the geometric quality of the airfoils, we propose the smoothness metric:
M =
NX
i=1
DistancePn⊥|Pn−1Pn+1|, (3)
where Pn is the n-th point, |Pn−1Pn+1| is the line connecting the adjacent points, and
Distance calculates the perpendicular distance from point Pn to the line |Pn−1Pn+1|. N
represents the number of generated airfoils.
• To measure the aerodynamic quality of the model, we propose thesuccess rate. We generate
airfoils and evaluate whether they converge under M different work conditions. The success
rate R is calculated as:
R = 1
N
NX
i=1
I(
PM
j=1 Cj
M > 60%), j= 1, ..., M, (4)
where Cj is a binary variable that takes the value of 0 or 1, indicating whether the jth work
condition results in non-convergence (0) or convergence (1), andN represents the number of
generated airfoils. Here, I(x) is the indicator function, where I(True) = 1 and I(False) = 0.

5 Benchmarking Results
The baselines in Sec. 4.3 are trained with 500 epochs and a batch size of 512. In the following, we will
present the results of our proposed method on controllable airfoil generation and controllable airfoil
design, as well as the ablation study to validate the effectiveness of the dataset and methodology.
5.1 Comprehensive Method Comparison
Controllable Airfoil Generation. We evaluated all our baselines and illustrate the experimental
results in Tab. 1, from which we can make the following observations. First, our proposed AF-
200K dataset is effective than previous datasets. As the dataset size increased from UIUC 1,600 to
Supercritical Airfoil 21,500, and finally to AF-200K, the results indicate that Label Error decreased,
Diversity Score increased (indicating generating more diverse airfoils), and Smoothness value
decreased (indicating better geometric quality). These results demonstrate that as the size and
diversity of the dataset increase, the model performance increases, which validates the effectiveness
of our proposed methods. Second, PK-V AE and PK-GAN, PK-V AE exhibits lower Label Error and
generates more consistent airfoil shapes, although with reduced diversity due to the strong constraints
imposed by the reconstruction loss in V AE. PK-GAN, compared to cGAN, shows by using Bézier
curves as intermediate representations, it generates smoother airfoil shapes. PK-V AE-GAN combines
the stability of V AE and the diversity of GAN, positioning its performance in between. The Diffusion
architecture is simpler and more stable in training compared to V AE and GAN. Comparing PK-DIFF,
based on raw data and Unet architecture, with PK-DIT, based on latent space, PK-DIT generates
more diverse and smoother airfoil shapes.
Controllable Airfoil Editing. For training the airfoil editing task, we randomly sample two airfoils
as the source and target. The airfoil editing task is divided into two parts: editing the control points
and editing the physical parameters. For editing the control keypoints, the model takes as input
(source-physical, target-keypoint) and is expected to output an airfoil that satisfies (target-physical,
target-keypoint). For editing the physical properties, the model takes as input (target-physical,
source-keypoint) and is expected to output an airfoil that satisfies (target-physical, target-keypoint).
The results for these two editing tasks are presented in Table 2. It can be observed that PK-V AE2
outperforms PK-V AE across the board. Specifically,PK-V AE2 achieves a lower label error in physical
parameter editing and demonstrates a higher diversity score and better smoothness in keypoint editing.
5.2 Ablation Study
Pretrain and Finetune. To verify whether the AF-200K dataset can help the model generate airfoils
with better aerodynamic capabilities, we select about 20,000 airfoils with superior aerodynamic
performance from the AF-200K dataset and then pre-train on the full AF-200K dataset and fine-tune

Different Generative Data. To evaluate the impact of different
generative data on the final model performance, we select 10,000
airfoils each from NACA-GEN, CST-GEN, BézierGAN-GEN, and
Diffusion-GEN, and train the model on these datasets. The results
are shown in Tab. 3. We find that, CST-GEN provided the model

highest score of smoothness. Diffusion-GEN impart the model with
the greatest control capability and the lowest label error.
6 Conclusion
We have proposed a large-scale and diverse airfoil dataset, AF-200K, which has been demonstrated to
significantly improve the capabilities of data-driven models compared to previous datasets. Addition-
ally, we have introduced a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance of mainstream
generative models on the task of airfoil inverse design. This benchmark provides researchers with a
valuable tool to explore more powerful inverse design methods.
As the availability of data continues to expand and AI techniques advance, there is great potential
to explore an even broader design space. AI-driven exploration can transcend the limitations of
human experience and create innovative structures that are beyond human imagination. In complex
design scenarios, AI may achieve superior outcomes compared to human experts. We believe that our
methods can also offer valuable insights for 3D airfoil design.
Looking ahead, we aim to establish a more comprehensive benchmark for both 2D and 3D airfoil
inverse design. The limitations of our current approach are discussed in Appendix F.

B Background and Related Work
In this section, we primarily discuss three concepts: airfoil design, airfoil representation and condi-
tional generative methods in airfoil design.
B.1 Airfoil Design
The essence of airfoil design is to find an airfoil that satisfies one’s requirements within a vast design
space. However, the traditional trial-and-error process is inefficient and costly. To address this
issue, a significant amount of research has been conducted, which can be broadly categorized into
airfoil parameterization [43], airfoil aerodynamic performance prediction [ 44, 45], airfoil inverse
design [7], and airfoil shape optimization [ 46]. Airfoil parameterization compresses the airfoil
into a few parameters, effectively reducing the design space to a parameter space, which can be
searched more quickly. However, parameterization may introduce discontinuities in the design space,
making it challenging to find the desired airfoil. Airfoil aerodynamic performance prediction can be
divided into two main approaches: using PINNs [47] to solve for the aerodynamic coefficients on
the airfoil surface, and employing data-driven surrogate models to quickly predict the performance
of the current airfoil, approximating the traditional CFD approach. Airfoil inverse design takes the
desired requirements as input and outputs an airfoil that satisfies those requirements. Airfoil shape
optimization aims to find the design variables that maximize the lift-to-drag ratio (Cl/Cd).
The ultimate goal of these four directions is to use algorithms to automatically find airfoils that meet
the given requirements. Airfoil parameterization can reduce the search variables, airfoil inverse design
can provide multiple candidate airfoils as initial values, airfoil aerodynamic performance prediction
can use surrogate models for rapid feedback, and airfoil shape optimization can employ optimization
methods to find the optimal airfoil. Previous efforts [ 26, 27] have explored datasets for investigating
airfoil aerodynamic characteristics, but have largely relied on the UIUC and NACA airfoil shapes,
lacking the breadth of data necessary to support the exploration of large-scale airfoil models. Our
dataset, on the other hand, boasts a more diverse collection of airfoils and rich annotations, enabling
better support for the four research directions mentioned earlier. Additionally, we have proposed
AFBench, which includes airfoil generation and airfoil editing. Airfoil generation is a combination and
complement to inverse design and parameterization, as it can generate airfoils that satisfy geometric
constraints based on PARSEC parameters. Airfoil editing is a supplement to shape optimization, as it
allows designers to more controllably find the optimal airfoil based on their experience.
13

B.2 Airfoil Representation
Airfoil representation is an evolution of airfoil parameterization. It can be broadly categorized into
explicit representation and implicit representation. Explicit representation includes the most common
Coordinate Point Method, as well as polynomial-based Parametric Representation Methods, such as
PARSEC [37], Bézier [35], CST [32]. The former is the easiest to manipulate, but the large number
of variables makes it difficult to optimize. The polynomial-based representations can reduce the
design variables while ensuring the represented airfoils are smooth. Some, like PARSEC, even have
intuitive geometric interpretations, such as leading edge radius and upper/lower surface peak values.
Other parameterization methods, however, have design variables that are less intuitive. Additionally,
their design spaces tend to be relatively small.
Implicit representation primarily uses data-driven methods to compress the airfoil into a latent space.
Traditional methods include SVD [48] and PCA [49], but these linear combination approaches also
result in small design spaces. More recently, neural representations have become common, where a
well-trained neural network can store the airfoil information, allowing the design space to be sampled
from a low-dimensional space. A representative work in this area is BézierGAN [ 33]. Our work
adopts a hybrid approach, combining implicit and explicit representations. By adjusting the intuitive
PARSEC parameters and control points, we can achieve airfoil generation. The neural network
representation allows for a much larger design space compared to pure PARSEC parameterization.
B.3 Conditional Generative methods in Airfoil Design
Leveraging the advantages of both implicit representation and generative methods, there recently
appears attempts to combine implicit representation and generative methods to achieve better design
performance.
V AEVariation Auto Encoder[28] trains a model to minimize reconstruction loss and latent loss, and
it is usually optimized considering the sum of these losses. [22] proposes two advanced CV AE for the
inverse airfoil design problems by combining the conditional variational autoencoders (CV AE) and
distributions. There are two versions: N-CV AE, which combines the CV AE with normal distribution
[50], and S-CV AE, which combines the V AE and von Mises-Fischer distribution [51]. Both the
CV AE models convert the original airfoils into a latent space. Differently, the S-CV AE enables the
separation of data in the latent space, while the N-CV AE embeds the data in a narrow space. These
different features are used for various tasks.
GAN Generative adversarial network [29] uses a generative neural network to generate a airfoil and
uses a discriminative neural network to justify the airfoil is real or fake. CGAN [15] improves the
original GAN by inputing the conditions to both the generator and discriminator. Then, the generator
is learned to generate the shape satisfying the condition constraints. Inspired by the big success
in computer vision, several works are proposed to explore the applications of GANs to solve the
airfoil design. [30] generates shapes with low or high lift coefficient. By inputing the aerodynamic
characteristics such as lift-to-drag ratio (Cl/Cd) or share parameters, it is possible to guide the shape
generation process toward particular airfoil.
Diffusion Diffusion model [17] is the recent widely adapted generative model in the image and 3D
computer vision. In the airfoil generation field, there are also several initial attempts to use diffusion
model to generate airfoils. [ 14] uses conditional diffusion models to perform performance-aware
and manufacturability-aware topology optimization. Specifically, a surrogate model-based guidance
strategy is proposed that actively favors structures with low compliance and good manufacturability.
[13] introduces compositional inverse design with diffusion models, which enables the proposed
method to generalize to out-of-distribution and more complex design inputs than seen in training. [31]
leverages the capable of a latent denoising diffusion model to generate airfoil geometries conditioned
on flow parameters and an area constraint. They found that the diffusion model achieves better
generation performance than GAN-based methods.
C Detailed Description of Airfoil Generation by CST Method
The CST-assisted Generation Stage augments the airfoils with physical models, i.e., CST model.
Given one airfoil f0, we generate the airfoils with assistance of CST by the following steps: (1) We
parameterize the airfoil f0 with the CST method [32] as p0; (2) Employ Latin Hypercube Sampling
14

(LHS) to perturb the CST parameters. LHS enables uniform sampling across the CST parameter
space, thereby facilitating the generation of new airfoils.
Parametrize the airfoils using CST Given one manually designed airfoil f0, we parameterize the
airfoil with the CST method as p0 = (p1
0, p2
0, ..., pM
0 ), where M is the number of physical parameters.
The CST method is a widely-accepted method in airfoil design and proposes to fit the supercritical
airfoil with the Bernstein polynomial, which can be mathematically expressed as
ζ(ψ) = C(ψ)S(ψ) + ψζT , (5)
where ζ = Y/c, ψ = X/c, and c represents the chord length. ζT = ∆ζTE /c represents the trailing
edge thickness of the airfoil. Here, X and Y are x-corrdinates and y-coordinates of the airfoil. C(ψ)
and S(ψ) correspond to the class function and shape function, respectively, which can be formally
described as follows:
C(ψ) = (ψ)N1 (1 − ψ)N2 (6)
S(ψ) = ζ(ψ) − ψζTp
ψ(1 − ψ)
(7)
where N1 and N2 define the class of airfoils. In this paper, we choose N1 = 0.5 and N2 = 1.0 to
represent the circular leading edge and sharp trailing edge of supercritical airfoils.
Perturb the CST parameters using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and generate new airfoils
Given the parameterized supercritical airfoil, we perturb the parameters of the airfoils with Latin
hypercube sampling (LHS). Take generating N airfoils based on one manually-designed airfoil
for example. For every variable in our parameterized airfoil, we evenly divided into N parts, and
randomly sample a value in N parts, respectively for N generated airfoils. With Latin hypercube
sampling (LHS), the generated airfoils can be uniformly sampled from the parametric space of CST
for supercritical airfoils. The generated aifoils are illustrated in Fig. 3.
D Detailed Description of Airfoil Generation by Generative Models
BézierGAN-GEN BézierGAN [33] uses a Bézier layer to transform the network’s predicted control
points, weights, and parameter variables into smooth airfoil coordinates. The Bézier layer formula is
as follows:
Xj =
Pn
i=0
 n
i

ui
j (1 − uj)n−i Piwi
Pn
i=0
 n
i

ui
j (1 − uj)n−i wi
, j = 0, . . . , m (8)
where n is the Bézier degree, m + 1 is the number of airfoil coordinate points, and Pi, wi, uj are
the network-predicted control points, weights, and parameter variables, respectively, which are all
differentiable.
By applying the aforementioned models, we uniformly sampled 10,000 latent codes from the range
[0, 1], combined them with Gaussian noise to form the input z, and used the generator to produce
10,000 smooth airfoil shapes represented as 257 x 2 coordinate points.
Diff-GEN Diffusion models [17] are a recent advancement in a generative modeling. Compared
to the traditional GAN models, diffusion models introduce the following main improvements: For
Noise Schedule: Instead of learning to transform noise to data directly, diffusion models gradually
transform noise into data through a series of small, reversible steps, which makes the training more
stable and produces higher-quality samples. For the model architecture, the generator is replaced
with a U-Net architecture that predicts the noise added to the data at each step, while a diffusion
process progressively refines this prediction. The forward diffusion process formula is as follows:
q(xt|xt−1) = N(xt; √αtxt−1, (1 − αt)I), t= 1, 2, ··· , T (9)
where T is the total number of diffusion steps, αt is a variance schedule controlling the amount of
noise added at each step, and N denotes a normal distribution. The model learns to reverse this
process, thereby generating samples from pure noise through a series of learned denoising steps.

of PK-DIFF samples, while the bottom row shows the visualization of PK-DIT samples.
Figure 8: Aerodynamic Performance Visualization between PK-DIFF (left) and PK-DIT (right).
Specifically for airfoil generation, we need to first encode the 257 x 2 airfoil coordinates into a
32x1 latent variable using a pretrained V AE. The diffusion model then learns to generate these
latent variables, which are subsequently decoded by the V AE to produce the final airfoil shape. This
approach leverages the strengths of both V AEs and diffusion models, where the V AE efficiently
compresses the high-dimensional airfoil data into a more manageable latent space, and the diffusion
model excels at generating high-quality samples within this latent space. By combining these methods,
we achieve a robust and efficient framework for generating realistic and high-quality airfoil designs.
E Diffusion Results
Reverse Diffusion Process. Fig. 7 illustrates the denoising sampling results of the Diffusion model at
different time steps. It can be observed that when trained directly on raw data, the generated airfoils
are not smooth. In contrast, airfoils trained in the latent space are smooth from the beginning due to
the pre-trained V AE providing a performance baseline. As the reverse steps increase, the generated
airfoils gradually align more closely with the given physical conditions.
Aerodynamic Performance Visualization. Given the same conditions, airfoils were generated
using both PK-DIFF and PK-DIT. We used a refined CFD solver OpenFOAM to calculate the flow
and aerodynamic performance of these two generated airfoils. Fig. 8 shows the distribution of the
pressure coefficient around the airfoils generated by PK-DIFF and PK-DIT. Under the given working
conditions [AoA = 3°, Re = 1e6], the lift coefficient (Cl) and drag coefficient (Cd) for PK-DIFF are
(0.36, 0.01029), while for PK-DIT, they are (0.7335, 0.0125). The higher Cl/Cd ratio for PK-DIT
indicates that the airfoil generated by PK-DIT has superior aerodynamic performance.
Generate Diverse Airfoils by PK-DIT Fig. 9 illustrates the diversity of airfoils generated by the
Diffusion model. Starting from random noise, Diffusion progressively denoises the airfoil. Each
16

denoising step can introduce different details, thus ensuring that the generated airfoils are diverse
while still meeting the required conditions.
F Limitation
The current physical parameters and control keypoints used in our approach are coupled within
each condition. For example, simply changing leading edge radius may not result in a feasible
airfoil, as the design space may not contain such a configuration. When dealing with multiple
conditions, finding and balancing the conflicts between the conditions to generate an optimal airfoil
is a challenge that remains unsolved and deserves further exploration. In addition to finding better
airfoil design variables, modeling the relationships between these variables is also crucial. Moreover,
our method currently does not integrate airfoil shape optimization techniques into the generation
process. Embedding optimization methods to produce generated airfoils with superior aerodynamic
performance, surpassing manually designed airfoils, would further demonstrate the effectiveness of
AI-based approaches, and is another area worth investigating.

Although some related datasets and works have been proposed, they do not take into
account the real needs of applications. Moreover, there is still a lack of large-scale
foundational data and evaluation metrics.
2. Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which
entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?
17

• This dataset is presented by HIT-AIIA Lab & Shanghai AI Lab & Shanghai Aircraft
Design and Research Institute.
3. Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the
name of the grantor and the grant name and number.
• This work was sponsored by Shanghai AI Lab.
4. Any other comments?
• No.
G.1 Composition
5. What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos,
people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings;
people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.
• AFBench comprises existing UIUC and NACA datasets, along with 2,150 manually
designed supercritical airfoils and airfoils generated by models, totaling 200k samples.
Each sample consists of a well-designed airfoil, accompanied by 11 geometric parame-
ters and aerodynamic properties under 66 work conditions. We made our benchmark
openly available on the AFBench github page(https://hitcslj.github.io/
afbench/).
6. How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?
• For AF-200K, there are 160K airfoils for training, 20K airfoils for valuation, 20K
airfoils for testing, 200K airfoils in total.
7. Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random)
of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the
sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe
how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set,
please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances
were withheld or unavailable).
• Both UIUC and NACA are open-source datasets. We use the proposed CST method
and unconditional generative models to derive AF-200K dataset. For AF-200K, we use
all samples of UIUC and NACA Open dataset.
8. What data does each instance consist of? “Raw” data (e.g., unprocessed text or images)
or features? In either case, please provide a description.
• Each instance consists of a well-designed airfoil, accompanied by 11 geometric param-
eters and aerodynamic properties under 66 work conditions.
9. Is there a label or target associated with each instance?If so, please provide a description.
• Each instance includes various aerodynamic performance metrics such as angle of
attack (AoA), drag coefficient (CD), and moment coefficient (CM), under different
work conditions. Additionally, PARSEC physical parameters are provided as geometric
features for each instance.
10. Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description,
explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not
include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text.
• No.
11. Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users’ movie ratings,
social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.
• No.
12. Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)? If
so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.
• We recommend using the default 8:1:1 ratio provided by AFBench for dataset partition-
ing.
18

13. Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please
provide a description.
• No.
14. Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources
(e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are
there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official
archival versions of the complete dataset (i.e., including the external resources as they
existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees)

G.2 Collection Process
22. How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly
observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or
indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses
for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from
other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.
• Our data is developing based on published airfoil dataset UIUC and NACA using a
designed CST method and unconditional generative models mentioned before.
19

23. What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus
or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)? How were these
mechanisms or procedures validated?
• For UIUC, we write a Python script that uses Bézier interpolation to generate a smooth
airfoil with a specified number of points. For NACA, we write an NACA generator
script to sample the airfoil at a specified number of points. For the rest, we use CST and
generative methods to generate the airfoils, then use XFoil to create the aerodynamic
labels, and a Python script to calculate the geometry labels. We use hundreds of small
CPU nodes and small GPU nodes for the computation.
24. If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g.,
deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?
• We use full-set provided by UIUC and NACA.
25. Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contrac-
tors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?
• No crowdworkers were involved in the curation of the dataset. Open-source researchers
and developers enabled its creation for no payment.
26. Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation
timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news
articles)? If not, please describe the timeframe in which the data associated with the
instances was created.
• The AF-200K data and label was generated in 2024, while the source data UIUC v2
was created in 2020, NACA v1 was created in 1933.
27. Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)?
If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well
as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.
• The source sensor data for UIUC and NACA had been conducted ethical review
processes by UIUC Applied Aerodynamics Group and National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics airfoils, which can be referred to UIUC and NACA, respectively.
